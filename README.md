# CPlusPlusBasics

### Synopsis

I found a C++ program of about 20 lines in this book 'Mastering C++: A Step by Step Guide for the Beginner and Advanced User ... '. 
As I'm attempting to learn C++, I thought I'd attempt to add some features to this program. Such as a home page and account page 
that feature some commands.
